		<h1>What is modernism?</h1>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="container-full-feature">
	<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, change began in the Western world.</p>
</div>

		<div class="container-narrow">	
			<div class="flex-grid-two">		

				<div class="col-gutter">
					<p>People became aware of their place in the world and examine what that meant. A long period of experimentation began across all mediums - philosophical, social, technological, and scientific; and change in one area fuelled change in others. For example, with new technology the concept of mass production emerged. Factories drew people in search of employment and with them their families. Society began to be focused into concentrated areas. The people of these new industrialised cities and towns had disposable income for the first time and so luxury stores and clubs sprang up. This later saw the emergence of posters and poster design. A revolution was taking place.</p>
					<p>In art, even the smallest change had massive impacts. The advent of oil paint in tubes or compressed charcoal allowed artist to leave their studios and go into the world they were trying to capture. Artists began to reject the traditional pursuit of realism for truth. One common thought was that life was not still and many artists wanted their work to reflect this. Degas, for example would sit in in theatres and try to capture the movement of ballet dancers by creating soft lines and using strong light and shadow. Later in life, even when he began to go blind, Degas used the new technology of cameras to help him better capture the movement of his dancers. Later, Picasso and the cubists attempted to capture the three dimensional form of the body by showing several sides of his subject at once on the canvas. Similar to Degas, he felt that there was more to life than still life and he attempted to capture this by showing the audience more than one view at a time – hence the moniker of cubism.</p>
					<p>After the devastation of World War I, people began to look more closely at themselves – it was a time of personal introspection. Virginia Woolf famously said "in or around December, 1910, human character changed." The excesses of the Victoriana, just a generation before, were appearing repulsive. This was the next step in the Modernist rejection of tradition and history. The focus became function and it was felt that function should dictate form. Creative minds felt they could design a better society by focusing on what one needs (OULearn, 2013). The architecture of the time in particular tried to capture this and began to use new technology to create the ultimate functioning buildings. The Rietveld Schröder House in the Netherlands, built by architect Gerrit Rietveld and commissioned by Truus Schröder is often considered the ultimate DeStijl house; DeStijl being one of the early Modernist movements. It was almost completely concrete and glass and requested by Schröder to have no walls so the inside was one with the outside. It is successful in that it has no traditional walls but sections of geometric shapes and abstract lines. Inside there are no walls but interchangeable sliding doors that allow the function of a room to change with the occupants needs. The materials used for a build of this kind were cheap and readily accessible so, towards the mid-twentieth century, an extreme version of the style became synonymous with social housing. Rather than letting the function of the building and its occupants needs dictate the structure, the architects used the relatively low cost to push the design; something that goes against the Modernist thinking behind the originals.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-gutter">
					<p>In Ireland, change typically happened much slower than the rest of Europe and it wasn’t until 1923 when artist Mainie Jellett exhibited the first abstract painting ‘Decoration’ that Modernist art reached Irish shores. A young cubism enthusiast, Jellett studied at the Metropolitan School in Dublin and then the Westminster School of Art in London. While at Westminster she trained with the Impressionist painter Walter Sickert. She later travelled to Paris and began studying under the cubist André Lhote. He taught her to take a form and reinterpret it using geometric shapes. Jellett was searching for something more, she wanted to push abstract to the extreme. It was when she worked with Albert Gleizes that she found her place in cubism. His method was to start with geometric shapes, pushing the form of the subject to the limits of reality. Like Degas, Jellett was interested in the movement of her subject and began to use colour to achieve it. She believed it brought a harmony to her paintings (Crawford Gallery, 2013.)</p>
					<p>When Jellett exhibited Decoration, 1923, it was met with almost exclusive criticism. The world of art in Ireland was not ready for such radical change. People could not understand why the artist chose this form and she even received accusations of blasphemy when people were informed that the subject is the Madonna and Child. Even her careful choice of colour, gold leaf for the halo and blue for the woman’s clothes, were not enough to convince that these geometric shapes were anything more than unnecessary abstraction and indecipherable. The artist was a devout catholic and this reaction was not her intent. She believed the shapes of cubism were reflective of Celtic art, Ireland’s heritage (Crawford Gallery, 2013). She began an arduous campaign to make the Irish public understand her piece. She appeared on radio, in newspapers, at lectures; anywhere she had the opportunity to try and convince people that this was a style to be celebrated. Perhaps it was the link to the traditional, the Madonna and Child or Celtic art, which allowed the public to eventually accept the artist and her painting, but they did. She went on to become an international spokesperson for Irish Modernism, representing the country at several international events including the 1928 Olympics. Such was her influence that in the year before her death (1943) she founded the Irish Exhibition of Living Art, an event that continues today.</p>
					<p>Modernism is an attitude of change; a period when people began to ask questions and pursue the answer and not just within art. They looked for ways to improve their lives with technology, their health with science and their well-being with art. They also began to blur the lines between theses disciplines. Beginning in the late 19th century and ending somewhere around the 1950’s, it is unfortunate that there appears to be overall less curiosity today.</p>
